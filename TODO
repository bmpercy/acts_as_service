TODOs
-----

put things in here that could be worked on

* extricate the gem from needing to run within Rails (maybe nothing to do here,
  maybe just coming up with different pidfile default path if RAILS_ROOT
  isn't defined. but including class can always just specify explicit path and
  should be fine
* incorporate ability for service to define a logger that will be used by
  the acts as service infrastruture (vs. just logging to stdout)
